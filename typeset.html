                What Is The Internet Like?

                The internet can feel like home.
                Everything and anything is accessible.
                You can learn new things.
                You can meet new people.
                You can be yourself there.

                Things to Remember:
            </p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>
                    You are a person outside of the internet.
                </li>
            </ol>
                <br/>
            <p>
                The internet is not home.
                People around you will get concerned if you spend too much time there.
                It can change the way you are, positively and negatively.
                The internet is a place you visit, not a place to live.
